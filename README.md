The world of business is becoming increasingly data-driven, and for good reason. Data provides critical insights to make better decisions, understand customersâ€™ behaviours, and optimize business operations. Businesses leveraging the power of data to make informed decisions, will gain a competitive edge and identify opportunities for growth. Therefore, businesses turn to OLAP Data Warehouse projects. Unlike traditional normalized database, it provides faster query performance, enabling users to quickly retrieve data and gain insights.

Inspired from the OLAP Data Warehouse project in previous company Yody. The database consists of 3 fact tables and 4 dimensions. Mock data is created by combining data from Kaggle. SQL queries, reporting, visualization and website.
